Alright perfect, now what I am thinking is that, what ai scanner is user for prediction by predict.py, it return a dish name from an array CLASS_LABELS, and I am thinking of add the nutrientDetails of each dish with them like, "Apple Pie: calories: 200, protiein: 400, fat: 40, carbohydrates: 15". and this should be returened, and when recieved in the ai_scanner page, these are also appeared along with the prediction name in the formate of "Apple Pie: calories: 1325, protein: 10g, fat: 65g, carbohydrates: 185g"... and I was thinking that  this can be done in the predict.py file only, as it is the one which return the prediction to the app. So can you help me with this?
